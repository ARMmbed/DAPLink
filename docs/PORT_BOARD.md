# Adding A New Board
A board is composed of a Hardware Interface Circuit and target MCU. To create a new board build a description needs to be added to `projects.yaml`. The yaml descriptions are used to create modules that can be inherited. Create a new board build by adding the product name and the required modules. eg: if the HIC is OpenSDA based on the NXP MK20D50 MCU

```yaml
    k20dx_myboardname_if:
        - *module_if
        - *module_hic_k20dx
        - records/board/myboardname.yaml
```

Next create a new file in the `records/board` directory called myboardname.yaml. This file defines the target MCU and allows overrideable board parameters to be configured. The target MCU in this example exists and is a Nordic nRF51822 (16k RAM variant)

```yaml
common:
    sources:
        board:
            - source/board/myboardname.c
        target:
            - source/target/nordic/nrf51822/target_16.c
            - source/target/nordic/target_reset.c
```

This assumes there is already target support present in the codebase. If adding a new target additional steps below will be needed. If the target support exists `source/board/myboardname.c` needs creation with a BOARD ID. To get a BOARD ID email support@mbed.org
```c
/**
 * @file    myboardname.c
 * @brief   board ID for myboard
 *

const char *board_id = "0000";
```

Now running `progen generate -t uvision` will create project files including the new board that can be developed and debugged. For more information about the yaml format [see the project_generator documentation.](https://github.com/project-generator/project_generator/wiki/Getting_started)
