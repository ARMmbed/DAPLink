/* Pin modes
*  =========
*  The EPUN and EPD bits in the SFS registers allow the selection of weak on-chip
*  pull-up or pull-down resistors with a typical value of 50 kOhm for each pin or the
*  selection of the repeater mode.
*  The possible on-chip resistor configurations are pull-up enabled, pull-down enabled, or no
*  pull-up/pull-down. The default value is pull-up enabled.
*
*  The repeater mode enables the pull-up resistor if the pin is at a logic HIGH and enables
*  the pull-down resistor if the pin is at a logic LOW. This causes the pin to retain its last
*  known state if it is configured as an input and is not driven externally. Repeater mode may
*  typically be used to prevent a pin from floating (and potentially using significant power if it
*  floats to an indeterminate state) if it is temporarily not driven.
*  Repeater mode is enabled when both pull-up and pull-down are enabled.
*
*  To be able to receive a digital signal, the input buffer must be enabled through bit EZI in
*  the pin configuration registers. By default, the input buffer is disabled.
*  For pads that support both a digital and an analog function, the input buffer must be
*  disabled before enabling the analog function.
*
*  All digital pins support a programmable glitch filter (bit ZIF), which can be switched on or
*  off. By default, the glitch filter is on. The glitch filter should be disabled for
*  clocking signals with frequencies higher than 30 MHz.
*
*  Normal-drive and high-speed pins support a programmable slew rate (bit EHS) to select
*  between lower noise and low speed or higher noise and high speed . The typical
*  frequencies supported are 50 MHz/80 MHz for normal-drive pins and 75 MHz/180 MHz for
*  high-speed pins.
