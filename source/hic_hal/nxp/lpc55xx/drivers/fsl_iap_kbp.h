 * @brief User-provided options passed into kb_init().
 *
 * The buffer field is a pointer to memory provided by the caller for use by
 * Kboot during execution of the operation. Minimum size is the size of each
 * certificate in the chain plus 432 bytes additional per certificate.
 *
 * The profile field is a mask that specifies which features are required in
 * the SB file or image being processed. This includes the minimum AES and RSA
 * key sizes. See the _kb_security_profile enum for profile mask constants.
 * The image being loaded or authenticated must match the profile or an error will
 * be returned.
 *
 * minBuildNumber is an optional field that can be used to prevent version
 * rollback. The API will check the build number of the image, and if it is less
 * than minBuildNumber will fail with an error.
 *
 * maxImageLength is used to verify the offsetToCertificateBlockHeaderInBytes
 * value at the beginning of a signed image. It should be set to the length of
 * the SB file. If verifying an image in flash, it can be set to the internal
 * flash size or a large number like 0x10000000.
 *
 * userRHK can optionally be used by the user to override the RHK in IFR. If
 * userRHK is not NULL, it points to a 32-byte array containing the SHA-256 of
 * the root certificate's RSA public key.
 *
 * The regions field points to an array of memory regions that the SB file being
 * loaded is allowed to access. If regions is NULL, then all memory is
 * accessible by the SB file. This feature is required to prevent a malicious
 * image from erasing good code or RAM contents while it is being loaded, only
 * for us to find that the image is inauthentic when we hit the end of the
 * section.
 *
 * overrideSBBootSectionID lets the caller override the default section of the
 * SB file that is processed during a kKbootLoadSB operation. By default,
 * the section specified in the firstBootableSectionID field of the SB header
 * is loaded. If overrideSBBootSectionID is non-zero, then the section with
 * the given ID will be loaded instead.
 *
 * The userSBKEK field lets a user provide their own AES-256 key for unwrapping
 * keys in an SB file during the kKbootLoadSB operation. userSBKEK should point
 * to a 32-byte AES-256 key. If userSBKEK is NULL then the IFR SBKEK will be used.
 * After kb_init() returns, the caller should zero out the data pointed to by
 * userSBKEK, as the API will have installed the key in the CAU3.
