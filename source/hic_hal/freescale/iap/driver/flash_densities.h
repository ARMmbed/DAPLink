//! @brief Table of flash sizes.
//!
//! The index into this table is the value of the SIM_FCFG1.PFSIZE bitfield.
//!
//! The values in this table have been right shifted 12 bits so that they will all fit within
//! an 8-bit integer. To get the actual flash density, you must left shift the looked up value
//! by 12 bits.
//!
//! Elements of this table have a value of 0 in cases where the PFSIZE bitfield value is
//! reserved.
//!
//! Code to use the table:
//! @code
//!     uint32_t flashDensity = kFlashDensities[HW_SIM_FCFG1.B.PFSIZE] << 12;
//! @endcode
extern const uint16_t kFlashDensities[];
