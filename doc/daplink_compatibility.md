# Compatibility

There are numerous different ARM MCU based Hardware Interface Circuits (HIC) that DAPLink firmware already operates on. As mentioned above these Debug Circuits can be standalone or embedded onto a bigger board (development kit or final product). Below is a list of devices known to be Compatible with DAPLink:
* Segger J-Link OB (Atmel SAM3U)
* Maxim Epsilon (MAX32550) - coming soon
* [NXP OpenSDA](http://www.nxp.com/products/software-and-tools/run-time-software/kinetis-software-and-tools/ides-for-kinetis-mcus/opensda-serial-and-debug-adapter:OPENSDA)
* [NXP Link based on LPC11U35 or LPC4322](https://www.lpcware.com/LPCXpressoBoards)

Vendors are encouraged and free to add their new boards and devices to support DAPLink!
