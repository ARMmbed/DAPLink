## Keil uVision MDK

Please note that we are currently using Keil uVision MDK 5 to build DAPLink firmware because of high quality of the produced code and small footprint of the binary, therefore you need this one to build the firmware on your own.

If you want to use the Keil uVision MDK IDE, you must launch it in the correct OS environment if you did not install it in the default location. The project will fail to build otherwise. To verify a proper launch of uVision use the `tools\launch_uv4.bat` script.
