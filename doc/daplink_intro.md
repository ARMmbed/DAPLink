Welcome to the
[ARM][arm]
[mbed][mbed]
[DAPLink][daplink] Handbook!

DAPLink is a versatile solution that allows rapid from scratch development of ARM-based embedded systems at no cost.
It is a bridge between target MCU and host SDK.
Using single USB connection, DAPLink provides Drag-n-Drop firmware programming (so called "flashing"), CMSIS-DAP based debugging, as well as easy interaction with target over Virtual-COM-Port based UART.
More features are planned and will show up gradually as project is constantly under heavy development, coordinated by founding [ARM Limited][arm], supported by numerous hardware vendors and the Open-Source community around the world.
DAPLink has superseded the "[mbed CMSIS-DAP][cmsisdap] interface firmware" project.
You are free to use and contribute. Enjoy!
