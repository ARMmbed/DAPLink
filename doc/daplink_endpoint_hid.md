# HID Endpoint Features

[USB HID](daplink_dictionary.md) has been selected as the transport layer for DAPLink features mainly because it needs no additional drivers to be installed on the user PC in order to work.
HID is also amazingly platform independent standard.
Just connect the DAPLink, launch the favorite debugger that supports DAPLink/CMSIS-DAP, and it works!
